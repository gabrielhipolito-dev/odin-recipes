        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This quick onigiri dish is also enjoyable to create!  These rice balls are a mainstay of Japanese bento <br>
            boxes.  You can make these rice balls with nearly anything; try substituting grilled salmon, pickled plums, <br>
            beef, hog, poultry, or tuna for mayonnaise.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Katsu Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
            <li>5 ½ cups water, divided</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup bonito shavings (dry fish flakes)</li>
            <li>2 sheets nori (dry seaweed), cut into 1/2-inch strips</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash rice in a mesh strainer until water runs clear. Combine washed <br>
                rice and 4 1/2 cups water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat,<br>
                stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low; cover, and simmer rice until <br>
                water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Let rice rest for 15 minutes to <br>
                continue to steam and become tender. Allow cooked rice to cool.
            </li>
            <li>
               Combine remaining 1 cup water with salt in a small bowl; use to dampen hands <br>
               before handling rice. Divide cooked rice into 8 equal portions. Use one portion<br>
               of rice for each onigiri.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide one portion of rice in two. Create a dimple in rice and fill with a heaping <br>
                teaspoon of bonito flakes. Cover with remaining portion of rice and press lightly <br>
                to enclose filling inside rice ball. Gently press rice to shape into a triangle;<br>
                wrap with a strip of nori and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Repeat with remaining<br>
                portions of rice.
            </li>
        </ol>
